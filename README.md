The project Smart Construction Site is an IoT-based safety monitoring system designed to track the health and wellbeing of construction workers in real time. Its goal is not to replace the supervisor, but to assist them by providing immediate insight into workers’ vital parameters and enabling automatic reaction in critical situations. Each worker wears a sensor wristband equipped with a heart-rate sensor (MAX30102) and a body-temperature sensor (MAX30208), which continuously send measured data to an ESP32 microcontroller. The controller evaluates the received values and detects dangerous states such as elevated pulse or high temperature. When this happens, the system automatically activates actuators on the construction site: using a GSM communication module (SIM800L/SIM900), it triggers an emergency call or SMS to medical assistance, and it can shut down machinery by activating an IoT relay (Digital Loggers Power Relay). All communication between sensors, controller, server, actuators, and the monitoring application is realized using the MQTT publish/subscribe protocol, implemented with the Mosquitto broker, while SSDP is used for automatic device discovery within the local network. In parallel, the server and administrator application receive the data over MQTT and HTTP, log events, display current statuses, and allow manual intervention if needed. The system therefore creates a complete automated safety loop: sensors detect a critical condition, the controller processes and reacts, actuators execute actions at the construction site, and the monitoring application informs the supervisor. The result is a real-time health-tracking safety system that significantly improves response time and reduces risk exposure for workers in hazardous environments.
