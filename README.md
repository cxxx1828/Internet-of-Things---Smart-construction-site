The project Smart Construction Site is an IoT-based safety monitoring system simulation designed to demonstrate real-time tracking of construction workers' health and wellbeing. Its goal is not to replace the supervisor, but to assist them by providing immediate insight into workers' vital parameters and enabling automatic reaction in critical situations. The system simulates worker sensor wristbands equipped with virtual heart-rate sensors (MAX30102) and body-temperature sensors (MAX30208), which continuously generate and send simulated data to a virtual ESP32 microcontroller. The controller evaluates the received values and detects dangerous states such as elevated pulse or high temperature. When this happens, the simulation automatically demonstrates actuator responses on the construction site: using a simulated GSM communication module (SIM800L/SIM900), it triggers virtual emergency calls or SMS notifications to medical assistance, and it can simulate machinery shutdown by activating a virtual IoT relay (Digital Loggers Power Relay). All communication between simulated sensors, controller, server, actuators, and the monitoring application is realized using the MQTT publish/subscribe protocol, implemented with the Mosquitto broker, while SSDP is used for automatic device discovery within the simulated local network. In parallel, the server and administrator application receive the data over MQTT and HTTP, log events, display current statuses, and allow manual intervention if needed. The system therefore creates a complete automated safety loop demonstration: simulated sensors detect a critical condition, the controller processes and reacts, virtual actuators execute actions at the construction site, and the monitoring application informs the supervisor. The result is a proof-of-concept simulation that demonstrates how a real-time health-tracking safety system could significantly improve response time and reduce risk exposure for workers in hazardous environments.
